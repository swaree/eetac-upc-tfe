\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the output of the \LaTeX\ template, based on \href{https://eetac.upc.edu/ca/els-estudis/TFE/maqueta-del-tfe}{EETAC's thesis style guide}. The main benefits of writing your thesis using \LaTeX\ are primarily the consistency of the results (no irreversible changes or different outputs depending on the machine) and the automation of the bibliography. It does take some amount of getting used to its way of working, but this template saves you a great deal of time (at the expense of mine :Ã¾).

To add more chapters, create a new file inside the \verb+chapters+ folder and add \verb+\include{name}+ to \verb+main.tex+.
